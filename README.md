👋🏻 Yo 

I don't code as much as I like. 
In fact, I don't code much at all. 

There's no time to actually sit and study (yes, I'm being real, it's not an excuse), so I'm just gonna do tiny stuff as frequently as possible. 

So, if you wanna be a good developer, there are some essential concepts you MUST wrap your head around. 
So, I'm going to do just that and work on those, exploring different languages. 

1. Data Structures and Algorithms
2. Problem-Solving Skills
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
4. Version Control
5. Testing and Quality Assurance
6. Software Design and Architecture
7. Programming Paradigms
8. Databases
9. Security Best Practices
10. Development Methodologies
12. Performance Optimization

Don't laugh at me if you see some weird stuff, you're not cool 💅🏼
